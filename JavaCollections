To create a collection on any user created type i.e. class type always override the hashCode and equals method as the collections method such as contains,indexOf() which will result wrong value.

Best practice

if(ArrayList.size == 0) //its a bad practice instead use:
ArrayList.isEmpty();

for(i=0;i<ArrayList.size();i++) //Here the function will be called everytime we iterates the loop so the function will be pushed to stack and will have performance issues.
instead use
for(i=0,n=ArrayList.size();i<n;i++)

ensureCapacity(new capacity) will ensure that if we are adding elements more than the actual then the capacity is already ensured
else a new arrayList will be created and all the elements will be copied and hence will have performance issues.
