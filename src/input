The input can be given at command line as "input1 input2 input3" (Weights separated by spaces)
You can use Scanner to read the input. Consider the sample code below:
Assuming the input is only integers.

 Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 int numOfBlocks = scanner.nextInt();
 int weightArray[] = new weightArray[numOfBlocks];
 for(int i=0;i<numOfBlocks;i++)
       {
        weightArray[i] = scanner.nextInt();
       }
 scanner.close();
//your logic
