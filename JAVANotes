Garbage Collection:
Whenever objects are created they are assigned memory in heap.
The Garbage Collection is done using the Mark and Sweep Algorithm(Stop or Run Algorithm):
It has two phases:
Mark Phase: To detect unreachable objects.
Sweep Phase: The second pass traverses all pointers, starting at the accessible roots of a program and for each object traversed it marks the object. The third pass walks linearly again and removes all objects that are not marked.
